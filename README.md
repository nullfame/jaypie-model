# Jaypie Gateway ðŸ”¹

JSON:API Gateway for AWS Lambda in Node.js

## Project Goals

* JSON:API-compliant backend built on AWS Lambda and API Gateway
* Model-Controller pattern for implementing JSON:APIs (for the view)
* Opinionated REST vocabulary
* Proper use of HTTP status codes
* Aesthetic syntax inspired by Vue and Laravel.  Not "fluent" per se but a natural programming interface focusing on a graceful developer experience

## INB4 "Yet Another Framework"

Most of what I have found:

* Focuses on routing, which I believe should be boilerplate we abstract away by following a REST vocabulary
* Is agonistic on the schema of the response, which I believe leaves a lot for the developer to figure out
